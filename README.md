# P1: Project: Bargain hunting (27-04-2023 Coop has broken the API's we use, I will try to keep an eye out for the fix, and the update the program accordingly)
Hello and welcome!
Here are some quick notes about the program:
* **Does not support** Æ, Ø, Å or other special characters 
* If any of the above letters are used - the program stops dead in it's tracks
* The Coop API is limited - to only 250 calls a month (Refreshes the 12th of every month, one API call is used everytime the program is restarted)
* The search function works the best, by searching in danish
