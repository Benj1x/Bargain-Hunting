# P1: Project: Bargain hunting (27-04-2023 Coop and Føtex has broken the API's we use. And don't seem to intend on fixing it. Therefore the project does not work)
Hello and welcome!
Here are some quick notes about the program:
* **Does not support** Æ, Ø, Å or other special characters 
* If any of the above letters are used - the program stops dead in it's tracks
* The Coop API is limited - to only 250 calls a month (Refreshes the 12th of every month, one API call is used everytime the program is restarted)
* The search function works the best, by searching in danish
